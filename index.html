As mentioned above, there are 3.5 billion probiotics in ProDentim, and it will be very
difficult to discuss all of them. It is very important to check the ingredients in a dietary
supplement prior to buying as it helps you understand what the supplement is made up
of and how it helps to improve your health.
Thankfully, the manufacturers of ProDentim chews have mentioned the ingredients list on
their official website so that customers can check them out to see if there are any
ingredients that they might not like or be allergic to. This also helps to create
transparency between the customer and the manufacturer and builds trust between the
two.
We will discuss a few of them along with some other ingredients that are used in the
formulation of ProDentim. The main ingredients of ProDentim are mentioned below:
1. Inulin.
Inulin is a popular form of prebiotic fiber that can be found in foods like garlic, onions,
leeks, artichokes, chicory roots, beans, and legumes. Though our digestive system
cannot digest prebiotic fiber, it is essential to stimulate the development of good bacteria
in the digestive system.
Inulin can be found in ProDentim in high quantities, which promotes the growth of
bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and clostridia. The bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids
which have numerous benefits such as lactate production, which is an important source
of energy for mouth cells, lactic acid production, which helps to lower the pH levels in the
mouth thus preventing tooth decay, and hydrogen peroxide production which kills viruses
and bacteria in the mouth.

2. Peppermint.
Peppermint is a widely popular product in many oral hygiene products. Its main
ingredient is menthol which stimulates the nerves in your mouth that send signals to your
brain to get you to spit something out or swallow something. This causes the contraction
of muscles around the mouth which leads to the production of saliva. A buildup of plaque
in between the teeth and gums can lead to gum diseases, and if left untreated, plaque
can harden into tartar which can cause periodontal diseases.
This can affect the ligaments and bones surrounding the teeth. Therefore, the use of
peppermint can reduce the chances of gum diseases. Peppermint also reduces the
harmful bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities, therefore, peppermint can also
reduce the chances of developing cavities. Peppermint also helps to keep your breath
fresh.
3. Malic Acid.
Malic acid is a sugar that can naturally be found in apples and is commonly used in food
and cosmetics. In the mouth, malic acid prevents the development of tartar. Tartar
develops due to the buildup of food particles on the teeth' surfaces. Tartar is composed of
minerals like phosphate and calcium, it is mainly to protect the teeth' enamel.
However, tartar hardens over time and may tarnish the enamel which makes the teeth
susceptible to decay. The malic acid in ProDentim gets into the bloodstream and travels
to all parts of the body and also binds the phosphate and calcium in teeth and bones
which in turn reduces the buildup of tartar.

4. Tricalcium phosphate.
Tricalcium phosphate is a compound that naturally exists in the human body and is a vital
part of our teeth and bones. It binds to phosphate and calcium and prevents them from
getting absorbed by the body. This prevents them from forming tartar and thus reduces
the chances of tooth decay.
TCP can prevent cavities from forming and also prevents the buildup of plaque or
calculus. Tricalcium phosphate has been included in ProDentim to improve dental
hygiene by removing bad bacteria from the mouth and promoting the growth of good
bacteria.
5. Spearmint.
Spearmint helps to improve dental hygiene and reduces bad breath. It helps to improve
the health of gums and teeth and protects them by stopping the growth of germs and
reducing inflammation.
6. Probiotics.

The probiotics in ProDentim boost the production of saliva to get rid of harmful debris and
bacteria before they even reach the teeth. Moreover, the probiotics in ProDentim
eliminate the bad bacteria from the digestive tract. Some of the probiotics used in
ProDentim are mentioned below:
7. Lactobacillus reuteri.
Lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic that has been proven to improve gut health and
balances out the bacteria in the intestines. It helps to improve the absorption of nutrients,
improves digestion, and reduces inflammation. It helps to protect against harmful
pathogens by killing the bad bacteria inside the body.
According to the official website, ProDentim chews can reportedly support healthy
inflammation, prevent gum diseases, and improve the health of oral cavities.
Lactobacillus reuteri has been found to be beneficial in improving dental plaque and gum
health, reducing gingivitis, and inhibiting the growth of candida species. It can promote a
healthy balance in the gut flora, which helps to protect against illnesses like inflammatory
bowel disease and asthma.
Research shows that Lactobacillus reuteri can have an impact on cognitive health as
well, and this strain of bacteria may help to improve memory function and learning ability
in children. Studies suggest that this strain could be useful for preventing brain diseases
such as depression, and Alzheimer's among other health benefits (see kerassentials).

People seem to neglect oral hygiene a lot, however, it is very important to take good care
of your oral health as bad oral health can have an impact on your overall well-being.
There are good and bad bacteria in the mouth, the equilibrium of which is important for a
healthy mouth.
Many people are unaware of the fact that there are certain toxic ingredients in
toothpaste, mouthwash, and other dental products that lead to the deterioration of tooth
health and in some cases can even cause gum diseases. These products can destroy
the microbiome in the mouth. It has been found that the bad bacteria in the mouth are not
to be blamed for an imbalance in oral health, but rather the lack of good bacteria is the
reason behind many dental diseases.
The good flora needs to flourish in the mouth, but they can very easily be destroyed by
common dental products that may contain toxic ingredients. This is why teeth can thrive
for thousands of years outside of the mouth in the form of fossils, whereas they can be
ruined by something as simple as chocolate while in our mouth. Poor oral health is
associated with tooth decay, periodontal diseases, oral cancers, and even chronic
diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
Therefore, to cater to all these issues Dr. Drew Sutton, MD, formulated the supplement
ProDentim which is an oral probiotic supplement that provides 3.5 billion colony-forming
units in a single serving. The main purpose of ProDentim is to enhance the oral
microbiome by boosting the saliva and by introducing beneficial bacteria to the oral
cavity.
The claims made by the manufacturers of ProDentim are quite bold, and some might
even find them fishy or hard to believe. This article will help you understand what
ProDentim is all about, and we will write down all the important aspects of the
supplement so you can decide whether it is the right product for you.
